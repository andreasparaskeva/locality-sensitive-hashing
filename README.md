Implemented three different approaches in order to identify pairs of the most similar users of Netflix. In order to achieve this, Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) technique has been applied to a customized dataset of the original used in the Netflix Prize challenge. The methods of measurements for similarity were the Jaccard Similarity (JS), the Cosine Similarity (CS) and the Discrete Cosine Similarity (DCS).
